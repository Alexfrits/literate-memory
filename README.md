## What is this trash repo?

The goal of this repo is to try to replace my traditionnal gulp tasks by a serie of npm scripts.

I know there are a lot of tuto, examples, opinions and package.json on the Internets, but I prefer to try by myself.

Thoses are test files, with next to  nothing in them. They are just there so that I can verify if my tasks work correctly.

## versions

v0.0.1 nothing works for now.
